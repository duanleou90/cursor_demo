- Some notes when generating uSync files:
+ GUIDs must be exactly 32 hexadecimal characters in the format xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx, where each x is a hexadecimal digit (0-9, a-f).
+ Key="bf-home-001-c972-498a-bcaf-f81a6c643182" is invalid (starts with bf-home-001)
+ Key="a6c0eba6-9960-42c9-bf9b-60e150b429aj" is invalid (ends with aj - 'j' is not hex)
